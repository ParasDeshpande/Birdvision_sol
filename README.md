# Flask Product Management API

This is a simple Flask-based RESTful API for managing products. It provides endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products, along with user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

## Features

- User authentication with JWT.
- Create, read, update, and delete products.
- Flexible pagination support for fetching products.
- SQLite database backend.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- pip package manager.
- SQLite (no additional setup required).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/flask-product-api.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd flask-product-api
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Configuration

- The default configuration uses SQLite as the database backend and a default JWT secret key. You can change these settings in the `app.py` file if needed.

## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. Access the API endpoints using tools like cURL, Postman, or any HTTP client.

## API Endpoints

- **POST /login**: User login endpoint. Requires username and password in the request body. Returns a JWT access token upon successful authentication.

- **GET /products**: Retrieve a list of products. Supports optional query parameters for pagination (limit and skip). Requires JWT authentication.

- **GET /products/<id>**: Retrieve details of a specific product by its ID. Requires JWT authentication.

- **POST /products**: Create a new product. Requires JWT authentication and JSON payload containing product details (title, description, price).

- **PUT /products/<id>**: Update an existing product by its ID. Requires JWT authentication and JSON payload containing updated product details.

- **DELETE /products/<id>**: Delete a product by its ID. Requires JWT authentication.

## Testing

You can test the API endpoints using tools like cURL or Postman. Ensure you obtain a valid JWT access token by logging in before accessing protected endpoints.
